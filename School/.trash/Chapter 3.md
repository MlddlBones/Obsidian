Matter- anything that occupies space and has mass
	ultimately composed of atoms,
		submicroscopic particles that are the fundament building blocks of matter
		in many cases atoms are bonded together to form molecules.
	There are 3 states of matter
		Solid- tightly packed molecules with little movement
			defined in a fixed shape
		Liquid- flowing molecules
			loosely packed
			indefinite shape that takes the shape of container
			energy between solid and gas
		Gases- very little molecules spaced far apart
			indefinite volume cant be compressed
			most energy
		4th state, Plasma- electrically conductive gas
	Pure Substances
		every particle is the same as the other
			Element- if it is the same atom than it is an element
			Compounds- if it is a combination of different atoms of different atoms but in a fixed ratio
	Mixtures
		mixture of different particles
			Homogeneous- uniform amounts of different particles mixed together
			Heterogeneous- not uniformly mixed but in layers
	Physical Properties
		properties that do not cause a chemical reaction
			appearance
			odor
			boiling point
			freezing point
			density
		changes in the appearance of matter but not composition
	Chemical Properties
		property only displayed through chemical changes
			reacts with air
			burns ignites
			rust corrodes
		changes in the composition of matter

Energy
	capacity to do work
		work is defined as the result of a force acting on a distance
	Energy can neither be created or destroyed
		bu it can change form and be transformed from one object to another
		gravitational potential energy → kinetic energy
		Elastic potential energy → kinetic energy
		Chemical Potential Energy > kinetic energy
			trinitrotoluene (TNT)

	Temperature
		Celsius and kelvin are used in science
		Fahrenheit
		Heat capacity
			the amount of heat needed to raise 1g of a substance by 1c
