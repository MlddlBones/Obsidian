Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are the front line of medicine, responding to medical emergencies outside the usual hospital setting. While Emergency Medical Services do their job, modern technology has and will always be advancing at rapid speed. How though could EMS follow and adapt to this advancement. Emergency Medical Services first and most obvious change would be to leverage the advancing technology for its own benefit. Some examples for how they could do this is, Drones to deliver medical equipment to remote or hard to reach places. GPS-enabled Dispatch systems can also be used to more easily direct EMS to a scene. Technology can also be used to improve EMS training, this can be done through using virtual reality to offer immersive and possibly customizable situations. AI driven analytics can also improve training as it lets weak spots be noticed and fixed. High quality simulations can also improve training, this consists of life like mannequins and simulation labs built to provide real situations for EMS providers to train and practice in. In the field more than just drones can be used to enhance medical care. Devices such as Electronic Patient Care Reports (ePCR) and Telemetry can share data between the hospital and the EMS in real-time. ePCRâ€™s allow patient information to be transmitted at real time between EMS and Hospital, Telemetry keeps real time electrocardiogram (ECG) data between as well.
