the body can be studied by its #Cavities and #Internal-Organs

A #Cavity is a hollow space that is surrounded by bones or muscle
	the #Cranial-Cavity lies within and is protected by the #Cranium

the #Spinal-Cavity is a continuation of the #Cranial-Cavity as it travels down the midline of the back
	lies within and is protected by the bones of the #Spine ( #Vertebrae)
	contains the #Spinal-Cord #Spinal-Nerves and #Spinal-Fluid 

the #Thoracic-Cavity lies with the chest and is protected by the breast [[Bone]]( #Sternum) anteriorly, the #Ribs bilaterally and the bones of the #Spine posteriorly
	the inferior border of the #Thoracic-Cavity  is the diaphragm, a large muscle that functions during [[Respiration]]

The #Abdominal-Cavity lies within the abdomen
	protected by the #Abdominal-Wall anteriorly and the bones of the #Spine posteriorly
	The #Pelvic-Cavity is a continuation of the #Abdominal-Cavity 
		surrounded by the #Pelvic-Bones anteriorly and bilaterally and the spine posteriorly
	These 2 cavities are often called the abdominopelvic cavity because their is no dividing structure
