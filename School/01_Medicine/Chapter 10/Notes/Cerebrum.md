The #Cerebrum is the largest and most obvious part of the #Brain. It is divided into #Lobes, each #Lobe has the same same name as the #Cranial-[[Bone]] that is above it. 

A very deep #Fissure divides the #Cerebrum into right and left halves, each half is a #Hemisphere 
	The only connection between the right and left hemispheres is the #Corpus-Callosum, an arch of #Nerves that allows the two(2) hemispheres to communicate with each other and coordinate their activities

The #Cerebrum Surface has elevated folds ( #gyri) and narrow grooves ( #sulci).

The #Cerebral-Cortex, or #Gray-Matter, is the outermost layer of tissue.
	Beneath the #Gray-Matter, the #White-Matter of the #Cerebrum is composed of the #Axons of #Neurons 
	Most of these #Axons are covered by a fatty, white, insulating layer of #Myelin

#Frontal-Lobe of the #Cerebrum 
	Originates conscious thought and intelligence.
	Predicts future events and the benefits or consequences of actions.
	Coordinates and analyzes information coming from other #Lobes of the #Cerebrum 
	Exerts #Conscious, #Voluntary-Control over the skeletal muscles
	Coordinates the #Muscles of the #Mouth, #Lips, #Tongue, #Pharynx, and #Larynx to produce speech
	Analyzes sensory information about #Taste from the #Taste-Receptor in the #Tongue and #Throat 

#Parietal-Lobe of the #Cerebrum
	Analyzes sensory information about #Touch, #Temperature, #Vibration, and #Pain from #Receptors in the #[[Skin]], #Joints, and #Muscles 

#Temporal-Lobe of the #Cerebrum 
	Analyzes sensory information about #Hearing from #Receptors in the #Cochlea of the inner ear
	Analyzes sensory information about smells from #Olfactory-Receptors in the #Nose 

#Occipital-Lobe of the #Cerebrum 
	Analyzes sensory information about vision from #Receptors in the #Retina of the #Eye 

#Right-Hemisphere of the #Cerebrum 
	Recognizes faces, patterns, and three-dimensional(3d) structures
	Analyzes the emotional content of words but not the actual words
#Left-Hemisphere of the #Cerebrum 
	Performs mathematical and logical reasoning and problem-solving and coordinates the recall of memories
	Contains the speech center and is important in language skills
