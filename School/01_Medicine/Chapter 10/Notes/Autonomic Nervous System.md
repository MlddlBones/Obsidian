The #Autonomic-Nervous-System controls the #Involuntary-Contractions of #Cardiac-Muscle in the #Heart as well, as well as #Smooth-Muscle around #Organs, #Glands, and other structures

Can be broken down into two(2) divisions
	#Parasymphathetic division
	#Sympathertic division

#Parasymphathetic Division
	Active during “Rest and Digest” activities
	Decreases #Heart-Rate, #Blood-Pressure, and #Metabolic-Rate
	Changes the diameter of the pupils in response to the level of light
	Increases the #Peristalsis in the #GI-Tract
	Causes secretion of saliva, digestive enzymes, and insulin
	Prepares the body for sexual activity
	Contracts the bladder for #Urination 

#Sympathertic Division
	Active when body is active or exercising
	Increases mental alertness
	Dilates pupils to optimize vision
	Increases #[[Heart]]-Rate and #Metabolic-Rate 
	Raises #[[Blood]]-Pressure 
	Increases air flow to the #[[Lungs]] 
	Increases #Respiratory-Rate 
	Causes release of stored glucose to meet increased energy needs
	Prepares the body for “Fight or flight”
