#Brain
	Amnesia
	Anencephaly
	Aphasia
		Loss of the ability to communicate verbally or in writing. Aphasia can occur with head trauma, a stroke, or a neurocognitive disorder when there is injury to or deterioration of the areas of the brain that deal with language and the interpretation of sounds and symbols. Patients with aphasia are said to be aphasic. 
		**Expressive aphasia** is the inability to verbally express thoughts. 
		**Receptive aphasia** is the inability to understand the spoken or written word. 
		Patients with both types are said to have **global aphasia**. Limited impairment that involves some difficulty speaking or understanding words is known as dysphasia. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause; speech therapy

	Cerebral Palsy (CP)
		Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development of the fetus’s brain or sometimes from a lack of oxygen during birth. This can cause spastic muscles; lack of coordination in walking, eating, and talking; muscle paralysis; seizures; or intellectual disability. 
		Treatment: Braces; muscle relaxant drug; physical therapy; occupational therapy; speech therapy
	Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)
		Disruption or blockage of blood flow to the brain, which causes tissue death and an area of necrosis known as an infarct. A CVA can be caused by blocking or disrupting the blood flow. An embolus (a blood clot that travels through the blood) can become lodged in a small artery to the brain, blocking the blood flow. High blood pressure can cause an artery, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation to rupture and hemorrhage and disrupt the blood flow. A CVA is also known as a stroke or brain attack. A transient ischemic attack (TIA), a temporary lack of oxygenated blood to an area of the brain, is like a CVA, but its effects last only 24 hours. A reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND) is a TIA whose effects last for several days. TIAs and RINDs are precursors to an impending CVA. The severity and symptoms of the CVA depend on how much brain tissue dies. A CVA can result in **hemiparesis**, which is muscle weakness on one side of the body. **Hemiplegia** is paralysis on one side of the body, and the patient is said to be hemiplegic. A cerebrovascular accident on the left side of the brain affects the right side of the body and vice versa A CVA can also cause amnesia, aphasia, dysphasia, or dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Prevention: Antihypertensive drug to control the blood pressure; carotid endarterectomy or aneurysmectomy 
		Treatment: Thrombolytic drug to break up an embolus that is occluding the artery; physical therapy; occupational therapy; speech therapy

	Encephalitis
	Epilepsy
		Recurring condition in which a group of neurons in the brain spontaneously sends out electrical impulses in an abnormal, uncontrolled way. These impulses spread from neuron to neuron. A seizure can be triggered by a flashing light, stress, lack of sleep, alcohol or drugs, or the cause can be unknown. The type and extent of the seizures depend on the number and location of the affected neurons. A patient with epilepsy is said to be
		**Epileptic**
			Also known as seizures or convulsions. There are four common types of epilepsy . With each type of epilepsy, the patient displays a specific EEG pattern during a seizure. Before the onset of a seizure, some epileptic patients experience an aura—a visual, olfactory, sensory, or auditory sign (flashing lights, strange odor, tingling, or buzzing sound)—that warns them of an impending seizure. After a tonic-clonic seizure, the patient experiences sleepiness and confusion. This is known as the postictal state. Over time, seizures can cause memory loss and personality changes.
		**Status Epilepticus**
			is a prolonged, continuous seizure or repeated seizures that occur without the patient regaining consciousness. 
			Treatment: Antiepileptic drug; sometimes surgery, if a tumor or a specific area of the brain is causing the seizures

	Hydrocephalus
		Condition in which an excessive amount of cerebrospinal fluid is produced or the flow of cerebrospinal fluid is blocked. The intracranial pressure increases, distends the ventricles in the brain, and compresses the brain tissue. Hydrocephalus is most often associated with the congenital conditions of meningocele or myelomeningocele (described in the next section), although it can occur in adults (normal-pressure hydrocephalus) when the cerebrospinal fluid is not absorbed back into the blood. Untreated hydrocephalus in infants and children results in a grossly enlarged head and intellectual disability. The patient is said to be hydrocephalic. A layman’s phrase for this condition is “water on the brain.”
		Treatment: Placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to move excess cerebrospinal fluid from the [[Ventricles]] in the [[Cerebrum]] to the peritoneal cavity

	Meningitis
		Inflammation and infection of the meninges of the brain or spinal cord caused by a bacterium or virus. There is fever, headache, nuchal rigidity (stiff neck with pain and inability to touch the chin to the chest), lethargy, vomiting, irritability, and sensitivity to light (photophobia). 
		Treatment: Vaccination to prevent bacterial meningitis in susceptible groups (particularly college students); antibiotic drug to treat bacterial meningitis; corticosteroid drug to decrease inflammation

	Migraine Headache
	Narcolepsy
	Parkinson’s Disease
		Chronic, degenerative disease due to an imbalance in the levels of the neurotransmitters #Dopamine and #Acetylcholine  in the brain. There is muscle rigidity and tremors. In the later stages, the patient has difficulty initiating voluntary movements except with effort and concentration. Other signs include a mask-like facial expression, shuffling gait, or inability to ambulate. Also known as parkinsonism. 
		Treatment: Drug that balances the neurotransmitters by increasing the amount of dopamine or inhibiting the action of acetylcholine in the brain, although this can only slow the progression of symptoms; there is no cure

	Syncope
		Temporary loss of consciousness. A syncopal episode is one in which the patient becomes lightheaded and then faints and briefly remains unconscious. It is most often caused by carotid [[Artery]] stenosis and plaque that block blood flow to the brain or by a cardiac arrhythmia that decreases [[Blood]] flow to the brain. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause.
	Neurocognitive Disorder (NCD)
		Disease of the brain in which many neurons in the cerebrum die, the cerebral cortex shrinks in size, and there is progressive deterioration in mental function Formerly known as dementia or senility. The most common neurocognitive disorder is **Alzheimer disease**, but NCD also includes traumatic brain injury (TBI), Parkinson disease, multi-infarct dementia (the cumulative effect of multiple cerebrovascular accidents), multiple sclerosis, the neurodegenerative effects of alcohol abuse and drug abuse, and other, lesser-known diseases. At first, there is a gradual decline in mental abilities with forgetfulness and difficulty learning new things, focusing on a task, remembering names, performing daily activities, planning, and making decisions. The patient uses the wrong words, is unable to comprehend what others are saying, and speaks or acts inappropriately. The more neurons that are destroyed, the greater the cognitive impairment. Psychiatric symptoms of depression, anxiety, impulsiveness, and combativeness can also occur. The symptoms become more severe over time, culminating in an inability to care for personal needs or recognize friends and family and complete memory loss. Treatment: Drug to inhibit the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, although this can only slow the progression of symptoms; there is no cure.

	Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)
		Trauma to the spinal cord with partial or complete transection of the cord. This interrupts nerve impulses to particular dermatomes, causing partial or complete anesthesia (loss of sensation) and paralysis (an inability to voluntarily move the muscles). An injury to the lower spinal cord causes **paraplegia** with paralysis of the legs. A patient with paraplegia is a paraplegic. An injury to the upper spinal cord causes **quadriplegia** with paralysis of all four extremities. A patient with quadriplegia is a quadriplegic. Also known as tetraplegia. Without nerve impulses, the muscles lose their tone and eventually **atrophy**. This is known as **flaccid paralysis**. However, the [[Reflex]] arc of the lower spinal cord often remains intact and, in response to pain or a full [[Bladder]], the spinal cord will send nerve impulses that cause the muscles to spasm. This is known as spastic paralysis. The bladder may also contract spontaneously, causing incontinence. Treatment: Traction with weights is applied to the skull to align the vertebrae; surgery may be needed to fuse damaged vertebrae; corticosteroid drug to decrease spinal cord inflammation; muscle relaxant drug; passive range-of-motion exercises and splints

	Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
		Chronic, progressive, degenerative autoimmune disorder in which the body makes antibodies against myelin. There is acute inflammation of the nerves and destruction of myelin (demyelination) with interruption of nerve conduction in the brain and [[Spinal Cord]]. The areas of demyelination eventually become scar tissue that hardens (sclerosis). These areas are known as plaque and can be seen on MRI scans of the [[Brain]]. MS can be caused by a triggering event such as a viral infection. Patients are typically in their 20s to early middle age. There is double vision, nystagmus, large muscle weakness, uncoordinated gait, spasticity, early fatigue after repeated muscle contractions, tremors, paresthesia, inability to walk, and sometimes dementia. Heat, stress, and fatigue temporarily worsen the symptoms. There can be remissions in which there is some improvement, followed by exacerbations or flare-ups, but always with worsening of the condition over time.
		Treatment: Physical therapy; corticosteroid drug; muscle relaxant drug
	Neuralgia
	Neuritis
	Neurofibromatosis
		Hereditary disease with multiple benign fibrous tumors (neurofibromata) that grow on the peripheral nerves. These are most noticeable on the [[Skin]], but they can be anywhere in the body—on the internal organs or even in the eye. They range in size from small nodules to large tumors. 
		Treatment: Surgical removal of large tumors that cause pain or disability
