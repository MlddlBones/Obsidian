#Neural-Tissue is made up of two categories of cells: #Neurons and #Neuroglia.

A #Neuron, an individual #Nerve-Cell, is the functional unit of the #Nervous-System. 
	#Nerves are bundles of individual #Nerve-Cell (Neuron)

A #Neuron consists of three(3) parts
	#Dendrites
	#Cell-Body
	#Axon

#Dendrites are a multiple branching structure at the beginning of the #Neuron 

#Cell-Body contains the #Nucleus, which directs Cellular activities. 
	Contains #Cytoplasm, structures in the #Cytoplasm produce #NeuroTransmitters as well as energy for the #Neuron.

#Axon are an elongated extension of #Cytoplasm at the end of the #Neuron 
	Larger #Axons are coverd by a fatty, white insulating layer of #Myelin that dramatically increses the speed at which an electrical impulse can travel along the #Axon 
	A #NeuroTransmitters released by the #Axon of the #Neuron travels across the #Synapse and binds with a receptor on the #Cell-Membrane of a #Dendrites of the next #Neuron, producting an electrical impulse

#Neurogila perform specialized tasks to help neurons do their work.
