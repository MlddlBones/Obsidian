	Babinski’s sign
		Neurologic test in which the end of the metal handle of a percussion hammer is used to firmly stroke the lateral sole of the foot from the heel to the toes. A normal test (negative Babinski) produces a downward curling of the toes. An abnormal test (positive Babinski) produces extension of the great toe and fanning out of the other toes. A positive Babinski indicates injury to the parietal lobe of the [[Cerebrum]] or to the spinal nerves.

	Glasgoe Coma Scale (GCS)
	Lumbar Puncture (LP)
		Procedure to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for testing. Also known as a spinal tap. The patient is positioned with the upper legs flexed toward the chest. This curves the spine and widens the space between the spinous processes of two vertebrae, allowing accurate positioning of a spinal needle. The needle is inserted in the space between the L3–4 or L4–5 vertebrae and into the subarachnoid space. Cerebrospinal fluid flows through the needle and is collected and sent to a laboratory. Before the spinal needle is removed, a calibrated manometer (a thin tube) can be attached to measure the intracranial pressure as the CSF rises in the manometer.

	Mini Mental status examination (MMSE)
	Neurologic Examination
	Spinal Traction
		Procedure in which a fracture of the vertebra is immobilized while it heals. Two metal pins are surgically inserted into the cranium and attached to a set of tongs with a rope and pulley and 7–10 pounds of weight. This keeps the vertebral fracture in alignment while it heals. A patient with a partially healed fracture of the vertebra can be fitted for a halo vest with pins in the cranium attached to a metal ring (halo). This allows the patient to be ambulatory.
