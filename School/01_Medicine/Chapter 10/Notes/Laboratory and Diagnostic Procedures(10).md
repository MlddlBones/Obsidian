#Lab-Tests 
	Alpha Feroprotein (AFP)
	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination
#Radiologic-Procedures 
	Cerebral angiography
	Computed Axial tomography (CAT, CT)
	Doppler ultrasonography
	Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
	Myelography
		Radiologic procedure in which a radiopaque contrast dye is injected into the subarachnoid space at the level of the L3 and L4 vertebrae. The contrast dye outlines the spinal canal and shows [[Spinal Nerves]], nerve roots, and intervertebral disks, as well as tumors, herniated disks, or obstructions within the cavity. The x-ray image is a myelogram. Because a myelogram can cause the side effect of a severe headache, an MRI scan of the spine is more often done
	Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
	Skull x-ray
