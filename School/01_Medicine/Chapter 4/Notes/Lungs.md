Spongy, air-filled structures

each lung contains lobes, large divisions whose dividing lines are visible on the outer surface of the lung

The Right lung
	larger 3 lobes
		The Right Upper Lobe (RUL)
		The Right Middle Lobe (RML)
		The Right Lower Lobe (RLL)
The Left Lung
	smaller 2 lobes
		The Left Upper Lobe (LUL)
		The Left Lower Lobe (LLL)

The rounded top of each lung is the apex
the base of each lung lies along the diaphragm

The bronchus enters the lung at the hilum(indentation on the medial surface of the lung)
	Inside the lung, the bronchus branches into **bronchioles** than **alveoli** 
	O2 and CO2 is transferred between the alveolus and a nearby small [[Blood]] vessel (capillary)
	Surfactant
		protein-fat compound that reduces surface tension and keeps the walls of the alveolus from collapsing with each exhale
		Secreted by alveolus
	Collectively, the alveoli are the **pulmonary parenchyma**, the functional part of the lung, as opposed to the connective tissue framework around it
