breathing in and out
	breathing in is inhalation
	breathing out is exhalation
	breathing is normally an involuntary process

the control center in the [[Brain]] regulates the depth and rate of respiration
	Receptors in large arteries in the chest and neck send these centers information about [[Blood]] level of O2; receptors in the [[Brain]] send info about the [[Blood]] level of CO2
	The respiratory control centers send nerve impulses to the phrenic nerve
		causing the diaphragm to contract and begin inspiration
	at the same time, the intercostal muscles pull the ribs up and out
	Eupnea
		normal depth and rate of respiration

5 separate processes
	1. ventilation
		Movement of air in and out of the [[Lungs]]
	2. External Respiration-
		Movement of O2 from inhaled air into the alveoli and then into the [[Blood]] and the movement of CO2 from the blood into the alveoli and then into exhaled air. 
		External respiration is the exchange of these gases in the alveolus
	3. Gas transport
		[[Blood]] transports O2 and CO2
		oxygenated [[Blood]] travels from [[Lungs]] to hear, where it is pumped throughout the body
	4.  Internal respiration
		Movement of O2 from [[Blood]] into cells and movement of CO2 from cells into [[Blood]]
	5. Cellular respiration
		O2 is used by the cells to produce energy in the process of metabolism
