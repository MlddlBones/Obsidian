The inferior end of the trachea splits into the right and left primary bronchi
	primary bronchi contain cartilage rings that provide support
	Each enters a lung and branches into smaller **Bronchioles**
		the smallest bronchioles have smooth muscle around them, but **no cartilage**
	the lumen
		central opening in the bronchi/bronchioles through which air passes
bronchopulmonary
	refers to the bronchi and [[Lungs]]
The bronchial tree
	trachea, bronchi, bronchioles
	lined with cilia
	small hairs that move in coordinated waves to carry mucus and trapped particles toward the throat where they can be expelled
