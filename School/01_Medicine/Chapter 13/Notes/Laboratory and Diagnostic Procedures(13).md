	Amniocentesis
		Procedure to test the amniotic fluid. Using ultrasound guidance, a needle is inserted through the pregnant woman’s abdomen and into the uterus to obtain a sample of amniotic fluid. This is done between 15 and 18 weeks’ gestation when there is a sufficient amount of amniotic fluid. The following tests are perform
		**Chromosome studies** of fetal [[Skin]] cells can determine the sex of the fetus and identify genetic abnormalities such as Down syndrome
		**Alpha fetoprotein (AFP)**. An increased level indicates a neural tube defect (myelomeningocele).
		**L/S ratio (lecithin/sphingomyelin)** test for fetal lung maturity. Lecithin is a component of surfactant that keeps the alveoli from collapsing with each exhalation. Sphingomyelin is also a component of surfactant, and its level is higher when the fetal lungs are immature; when the [[Lungs]] are mature, the lecithin level is high

	Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)
	Pregnancy Test
		Blood test to detect human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) secreted by the fertilized ovum. Serum HCG is positive just 9 days after conception. Home pregnancy tests that detect HCG in the urine are easy to use but are not always accurate. Only a positive [[Blood]] test (serum beta HCG) is diagnostic of pregnancy. The presence of HCG does not indicate that the pregnancy is normal because HCG is also produced when there is an ectopic pregnancy or a hydatidiform mole.
#Radiologic-Procedures
	Hysterosalpingography
		Procedure in which radiopaque contrast dye is injected through the cervix and into the uterus. It coats and outlines the uterus and [[Uterine Tubes]] and shows narrowing, scarring, and blockage. The x-ray image is a Hysterosalpingogram. This test is done as part of an infertility workup

	Ultrasonography
		Procedure that uses ultra high-frequency sound waves emitted by a transducer or probe to produce an image on a computer screen. Three-dimensional ultrasonography couples the ultrasound with a position sensor to generate a high-resolution image in three dimensions. The ultrasound image is a sonogram. Ultrasonography of the breast or [[Uterus]] can differentiate between benign, fluid-filled cysts and solid tumors that need to be biopsied. A pelvic ultrasound can be used to diagnose a normal pregnancy versus a hydatidiform mole or ectopic pregnancy. In early pregnancy, the beating [[Heart]] is seen. The image can show multiple fetuses and the sex of the fetus. An ultrasound is done routinely at 16–20 weeks in a normal pregnancy to estimate the gestational age. Serial ultrasounds can be done over time if there is a question of intrauterine growth retardation. The length of the femur of the fetus, its biparietal diameter (BPD) (distance between the two parietal bones of the cranium), and the crown-to-rump length are used to calculate the gestational age of the fetus. Ultrasound can show the position of the placenta to diagnose placenta previa. Pelvic ultrasound is used during amniocentesis to locate a large area of amniotic fluid in which to insert the needle. A transvaginal ultrasound uses an ultrasound probe inserted into the [[Vagina]] to determine the thickness of the endometrium in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding
