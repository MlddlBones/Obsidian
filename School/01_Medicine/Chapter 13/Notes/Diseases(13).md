#Vagina
	Bacterial Vaginosis
	Candidiasis
		Yeast infection of the vagina due to Candida albicans. There is vaginal itching and leukorrhea, a cheesy, white discharge. Candidiasis can occur after taking an antibiotic drug for a bacterial infection. The antibiotic drug kills the disease-causing bacteria, but yeast (which is always present to some degree in the vagina) is not affected by the antibiotic drug, and so it multiplies and causes an infection. 
		Treatment: Antiyeast drug applied topically in the [[Vagina]]

	Dyspareunia
	Rectocele
	Vaginitis

		Discharge of milk from the [[Breasts]] when the patient is not pregnant or breastfeeding. It is caused by an increased level of prolactin from an adenoma (benign tumor) in the anterior pituitary gland. 
		Treatment: Drug to decrease prolactin production; surgery to remove the adenoma from the anterior [[Pituitary Gland]] in the 
			galact/o- milk
			-rrhea flow; discharge
	Mastitis
		Inflammation or infection of the breast. It is caused by milk engorgement in the breast or by an infection due to the bacterium **Staphylococcus aureus** from the nursing infant’s mouth or on the mother’s [[Skin]]. The affected breast is red and swollen, and the mother has a fever.

		Treatment: Emergency cesarean section
	Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)
