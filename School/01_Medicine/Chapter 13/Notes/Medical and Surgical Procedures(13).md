	Dilation and Curettage (D&C)
		Procedure to remove abnormal tissue from inside the [[Uterus]] for the purpose of treating abnormal uterine bleeding, diagnosing uterine cancer, performing a therapeutic abortion, or removing the products of conception following a spontaneous but incomplete abortion. The cervix is dilated with progressively larger dilators inserted into the cervical os. A **tenaculum** (long, scissors-like instrument with two curved, pointed ends) is used to grasp and hold the cervix. Then a **Curet** (instrument with a sharp- edged circular or oval ring at one end) is inserted to scrape the endometrium. Alternatively, a vacuum aspirator is inserted to suction out pieces of endometrium

	Mammoplasty
		Procedure to change the size, shape, or position of the breast. Also known as a mammoplasty.

		A **reduction mammaplasty** reduces the size of a large, pendulous breast. The procedure can be performed in conjunction with a mastopexy (breast lift) to reposition a sagging breast
		A **reconstructive mammaplasty** is done to reconstruct a breast after a mastectomy
