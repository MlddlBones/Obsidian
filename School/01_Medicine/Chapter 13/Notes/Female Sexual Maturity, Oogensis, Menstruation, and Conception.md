The #Anterior-Pituitary-Gland in the #[[Brain]] begins to scerete #Follicle-Stimulation-Hormone ( #FSH) and #Luteinizing-Hormone ( #LH) to stimulate #Ovaries at the onset of #Puberty.

#FSH stimulates a #Follicle in the #Ovary to enlarge and produce a #Mature-Ovum and secrete #Estradiol, which causes the development of female Sexual characteristics.

#LH stimulates a single #Follicle each month to rupture and release its #Mature-Ovum.
	#LH stimulates the ruptured #Follicle ( #Corpus-Leteum) to secrete #Estradiol and #Progesterone.

The #[[Ovaries]] secrete three(3) #Hormones 
	#Estradiol 
		Most abundant and biologically active female #Hormones 
	#Progesterone 
		Causes #Endometrium to thicken
	#Testosterone 
		Plays a role in female sexual drive

#Coneption
	#Spermatoza reach the #Ovum 24-48 hours after sexual intercourse's
	Chemical secreted by #Ovum attract the #Spermatoza 
	Only one #Spermatoza penetrates the #Ovum 
		This is the moment of #Fertilization, or #Conception
	The resulting #Cell has 46 #Chromosomes and is known as a #Zygote 
	#Pregnancy begins at the moment of #Conception 

A #Zygote immediately begins to divide as it moves through the #Uterine-Tubes.
	The inner mass of #Cells becomes the #Amnion and the #Embryo
	The developing #Embryo floats in and is cushioned by the #Amniotic-Fluid
	After 4days of development the #Zygote is known as an #Embryo 
	After 8 weeks it is known as a #Fetus 
	#Gestation is from the moment of conception to the moment of #Birth approximately 38-42 weeks
