The #Epidermis is the Thin outermost layer of the [[Skin]]

Contains cells that have no #Nuclei and are filled #Keratin a hard fibrous protein 
	These cells form a protective layer but they are dead cells so they are **constantly being shed or sloughed off** in the process known as #Exfoliation

The Deepest part ( #Basal-layer) is composed of living cells that are constantly dividing and being forced to the surface ( #Exfoliation)

Doesnâ€™t contain any [[Blood]] vessels
	receives nutrients and oxygen from the [[Blood Vessels]] in the [[Dermis]]

Contains #Melanocytes, pigment cells that produce #Melanin, a dark drown or black pigment that absorbs ultraviolet light from the sun to protect the #DNA in [[Skin]] cells from undergoing genetic mutations
