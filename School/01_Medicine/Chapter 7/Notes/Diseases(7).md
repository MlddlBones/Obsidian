	Neoplasm
		A tumor (neoplasm) is a solid mass of tissue that forms when abnormal cells group together. They can form most anywhere in your body, including your bones, [[Skin]], tissue, organs and glands. Many tumors are benign, which means they’re not cancer. You may or may not need treatment for them. Cancerous, or malignant, tumors require cancer treatment.

		Skin rashes can be red, inflamed, bumpy as well as dry, itchy or painful. The main cause is dermatitis, which is when your skin reacts to allergens or irritants.
