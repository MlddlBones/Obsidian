 The GI system begins at #Oral-Cavity. #Oral-Cavity contains the #Teeth, #Gums, #Tongue, #Hard-Palate, and #Soft-Palate, and the #Uvula.

	the oral cavity is lined with #Mucosa, a thin #Mucous-Membrane
	Receptors on the #Tongue perceive taste and send this sensory info to the #Gustatory-Cortex in the [[Brain]]
	the sight, smell and taste of food cause the #Salivary-Glands to release saliva into the mouth. this process moistens food as they are shewed and swallowed
		#Saliva contains an #Enzyme that begins [[Digestion]]
		#Salivary-Glands
			#Parotid-Glands
			#Sublingual-Gland
			#Submandibular-Glands

	#Mastication 
		the process of the #Teeth grinding/tearing/chewing food
		the #Tongue moves food toward the #Teeth and mixes it with #Saliva
		swallowing ( #Deglutition) moves food into the #[[Pharynx]](Throat)
		when food is swallowed, muscles in the neck pull the #Larynx upward to close against the #Epiglottis, so that food in the #Pharynx does not enter the #Larynx, #Trachea, and #[[Lungs]]. If the #Larynx is not closed, food in the back of the #[[Pharynx]] pressing on the #Uvula initiates the #Gag-[[Reflex]].
