2 parts to digestion
	#Mechanical-Digestion
		Involves #Mastication, #Deglutition, and #Peristalsis to break down foods
		also involves breaking apart fats in the #Duodenum
			fatty chyme stimulates the #Duodenum to secrete the hormone #Cholecytokinin
				stimulates the #[[Gallbladder]] to contract and release bile
				bile breaks apart large globules of fat during the process of emulsification
	#Chemical-Digestion
		#Enzymes and #Acids are used to break down foods
		#Amylase
			#Enzyme in saliva, begins to break down carbohydrate foods in the mouth
		The stomach secretes the following substances that continue the process of chemical digestion
			#Hydrochloric-Acid
			#Pepsinogen
			#Gastrin
		The stomach secretes a substance known as #Intrinsic-Factor, which helps vitamin B<sub>12</sub> be absorbed from the intestines' into the blood
		When [[Stomach]] does not produce enough #Intrinsic-Factor vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is not absorbed

#Chemical-Digestion continues in the #Small-Intestine
	#Cholecysytokinin stimulates the #[[Pancreas]] to secrete digestive #Enzymes into the #Duodenum
		#Amylase
		#Lipase
		other enzymes that break down proteins
	The #Villi of the #Small-Intestine produce digestive enzymes such as lactase to break down the sugar in milk
		The sugars in carbohydrates, starches and milk are broken down tot the simple sugar glucose which is the only source of energy that body cells can use
	Absorption of nutrients and water through the intestinal wall into the blood takes place in the [[Small Intestine]]. Absorption of water continues in the large intestines'
	Absorbed nutrients are carried by blood to the liver
	The liber plays an important tole in regulating nutrients such glucose and amino acids
	Excess glucose in the blood is stored in the [[Liver]] as glycogen and released when the [[Blood]] glucose level is low
	elimination occurs when undigested materials and water are eliminated from the body in a solid waste form known as feces or stool
	the process of elimination is a bowel movement or defecation
