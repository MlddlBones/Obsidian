The #Abdominopelvic-Cavity Contains the largest organs of the gastrointestinal system. The walls of the cavity are lined with #Peritoneum 
	membrane that secretes #Peritoneal-Fluid
	#Peritoneal-Fluid fills the spaces between the organs and allows them to slide past each other during the movement of [[Digestion]]

The #Peritoneum extends into the center of the cavity as the #Omentum
	the #Omentum supports the #Stomach and hangs down as a fatty apron to cover and protect the #Small-Intestine
	The #Peritoneum also becomes the #Mesentery, a thick, fan-shaped sheet that supports the #Jejunum and #Ileum

the [[Blood]] supply to the #[[Stomach]], #Small-Intestine, #[[Liver]], #[[Gallbladder]], and #[[Pancreas]] comes from the #Celiac-Trunk
	branch of the #Aorta, the largest #[[Artery]] in the body
