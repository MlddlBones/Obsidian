The #Liver is the Largest solid organ in the body. It is located in the upper right #Abdominal-Cavity. It is an **accessory organ of [[Digestion]]**
	  contributes to, but is not physically involved in, the process of [[Digestion]]

#Liver cells ( #Hepatocytes)
	continuously produces #Bile
		yellow-green, bitter-tasting, thick fluid

#Bile produced by the #Liver flows through the #Common-Hepatic-Duct and into the #Common-Bile-Duct toward the #Duodenum. when that duct is full, #Bile flows into the #Cystic-Duct and #[[Gallbladder]]
	all of the ducts that carry #Bile are collectively known as the #Biliary-Tree
