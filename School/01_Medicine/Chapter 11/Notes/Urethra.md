The #Urethra is a tube that carries #urine from the #[[Bladder]] to the outside of the body
	In men the #Urethra is 7-8in long

As the #Urethra leaves the #Bladder, it travels through the center of the #Prostate-Gland, a donut-shaped gland at the base of the #Bladder 
	Enlargement of the #Prostate-Gland can affect the #Urinary-System by pressing on and narrowing the #Urethra 

The #Urethra is part of both the #Urinary and #Male-Reproductive-System because ti transports both #Urine and #Semen 

In women the #Urethra is much shorter, traveling only 1-2in from the #Bladder tot he external surface of the body
