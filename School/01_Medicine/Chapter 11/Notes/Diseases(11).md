#Kidneys and #[[Ureters]]
	Glomerulonephritis
		Infection and inflammation of the glomeruli. This complication develops after an acute infection caused by streptococcal bacteria or by viruses. The original infection, which is often a strep throat, causes the immune system to produce antibodies. These combine with the bacteria or viruses to form antigen–antibody complexes that clog the pores of the capillaries of the glomerulus, and urine production decreases. 
		Treatment: Antibiotic drug for a bacterial infection; corticosteroid drug to decrease inflammation; renal dialysis, if necessary
	Hydronephrosis
		Condition in which urine distends the renal pelvis and calices or ureter. This happens when a blood clot, infection, or a kidney stone blocks the flow of urine. In **caliectasis**, the calices of the kidney are enlarged.
		 In **hydroureter**, only the ureter is enlarged. 
		Treatment: Treat the underlying cause.
	Nephrolithiasis
		Formation of a **kidney stone** (also known as a calculus) in the [[Urinary System]]. Kidney stones can vary in size from microscopic (often referred to as sand or gravel) to large and can be numerous or large enough to fill the renal pelvis or block the ureter. 
		Also known as **calculogenesis**. Kidney stones are composed of magnesium, calcium, or uric acid crystals. Renal colic is a spasm of smooth muscle of the ureter or bladder as the kidney stone’s jagged edges scrape the mucosa. This causes severe pain, nausea and vomiting, and hematuria. 
		Treatment: Many stones reach the bladder and are eliminated spontaneously during urination. Stones that do not pass spontaneously can be destroyed (by lithotripsy) or removed surgically (by stone basketing or nephrolithotomy), depending on the size and location of the stone.

	Nephropath
	Nephroptosis
		Abnormally low position of a kidney 
		Treatment: It sometimes requires surgery, but more often is mentioned as an incidental finding seen on an x-ray.
	Nephrotic Syndrome
		Damage to the pores of the [[Capillaries]] of the glomerulus. This allows large amounts of albumin (protein) to leak into the urine, decreasing the amount of protein in the blood. This changes the osmotic pressure of the blood and allows fluid to go into the tissues, producing edema in the extremities; fluid also goes into the abdominal cavity, producing ascites (a grossly enlarged, fluid-distended abdomen). 
		Treatment: Diuretic drug to decrease edema; correct the underlying c

	Pyelonephritis
		Infection and inflammation of the renal pelvis of the kidney. It is caused by a bacterial infection of the bladder that ascends the ureters and goes into the kidneys. 
		Treatment: Antibiotic drug
	Renal cell cancer
		Cancerous tumor (carcinoma) that begins in the epithelial cells that line the tubules of the nephron. 
		**Wilms tumor** is cancer of embryonal cells that still remain in the kidney. It occurs in children; also known as nephroblastoma. 
		Treatment: Surgery to remove the kidney (nephrectomy); radiation therapy; chemotherapy drug
	Renal failure
		Disease in which the kidneys decrease and then stop producing urine. This is due to an acute or chronic disease process
		**Acute kidney injury (AKI)** occurs suddenly and is usually due to trauma, severe blood loss, or overwhelming infection. It is caused by acute tubular necrosis, the sudden destruction of large numbers of nephrons and their tubules. Previously known as **acute renal failure (ARF)**
		**Chronic kidney disease (CKD)** begins with renal insufficiency, followed by gradual worsening with progressive damage to the kidneys from chronic, uncontrolled **diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or glomerulonephritis**. Symptoms and signs do not appear until 80 percent of kidney function has been lost. Previously known as **chronic renal failure (CRF).**
		**End-stage renal disease (ESRD)** is the final, irreversible stage of chronic renal failure in which there is little or no remaining kidney function. 
		Treatment: Treat the underlying cause; treat end-stage failure with renal dialysis or kidney transplantation
	Uremia
		An excessive amount of the waste product urea in the blood because of renal failure. The kidneys are unable to remove urea, and it reaches a toxic level in the blood. 
		Treatment: Renal dialysis
#Bladder 
	Bladder cancer
		Cancerous tumor (carcinoma) of the epithelial cells lining the bladder, most commonly seen in men over age 60. **Hematuria** is often the first symptom. 
		Treatment: Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor; surgery to remove the bladder (cystectomy); radiation therapy; intravesical insertion of a chemotherapy drug through a catheter into the b

	Cystocele
	Neurogenic Bladder
	Overactive Bladder
	Urinary Retention
		Inability to empty the bladder because of an obstruction (enlargement of the prostate gland or a kidney stone), nerve damage (neurogenic bladder), or as a side effect of certain drugs. Even when the bladder contracts, a large amount of postvoid residual urine remains in the bladder. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause
	Vesicovaginal fistula
		Formation of an abnormal passageway (fistula) connecting the bladder to the vagina. Urine flows into the [[Vagina]] and leaks continually to the outside of the body. 
		Treatment: Surgical correctio

#Urine and #Urination
	Albuminuria
		Presence of albumin in the urine. Albumin is the major protein in the blood, and so this is also called proteinuria. Normally there is no protein in the urine because albumin molecules are too large to pass through pores in the capillaries of the glomerulus; but when there is kidney disease, albumin passes through the damaged pores and is excreted in the urine. Albuminuria is an important first sign of kidney disease. It is also present in pregnant women who are developing preeclampsia (described in Chapter 12, Gynecology and Obstetrics). Treatment: Correct the underlying cause
	Anuria
	Bacteriuria
	Dysuria
	Enuresis
	Frequency
	Glycosuria
	Hemturia
	Hesitancy
	Hypokalemia
		A decreased amount of potassium in the blood. It is usually due to a diuretic drug that causes the kidneys to excrete an excessive amount of urine (and potassium). 
		Treatment: Adjust the dose of the diuretic drug.
	Incontinence
	Ketonuria
		Ketones in the urine. Ketones are waste products produced when fat is metabolized. Ketonuria is seen in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus who metabolize fat for energy because they cannot metabolize glucose. It is also seen in malnourished patients who do not have enough glucose in the [[Blood]] and must metabolize their own body fat. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause
	Nocturia
	Oliguria
		Decreased production of urine due to kidney failure. Dehydration can cause temporary oliguria. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause
	Ployuria
		Excessive production of urine due to uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause
	Pyuria
	Urgency
	Unrinary Tract Infection (UTI)
		Bacterial infection somewhere in the urinary tract. It is most often caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is normally found in the intestines and rectum. Because of the short length of the urethra in women and its location close to the anus, women are more prone than men to develop urinary tract infections. A UTI can involve just the urethra (urethritis), the [[Bladder]] (cystitis), or the renal pelvis of the kidney (pyelonephritis). 
		Treatment: Antibiotic drug
