#Kidneys, have a **Reddish-Brown** color, and are **Shaped like Kidney Beans**
	Measure 4in long, and 2in wide, and weigh that 1/2 lbs
	The **upper end** of each is **under the lower edge** of the #Rib-cage in the **flank area of the back**

The #Hilum is an indentation on the #Medial surface of the kidney where the #Renal-[[Artery]] enters and the #Renal-Vein and the #Ureter exit

A #Fibrous-Capsule surround the #Kidneys 
	Just **beneath the capsule** is the #Cortex
	**Beneath** that is the #Medulla that **contain the triangular-shaped** #Renal-Pyramid
	The tip of each #Renal-Pyramid connect to a #Minor-Calyx, **a duct that collects urine**

Several #Minor-Calices drain into a #Major-Calyx 
	#Major-Calices drain into the #Renal-Pelvis, a large, funnel-shaped area that narrows to become the #Ureter 
	#Urine flows continuously through #Minor-Calices, #Major-Calices, the #Renal-Pelvis, and into the #Ureter 

Besides Producing and excreting #Urine the #Kidneys help the body maintain a normal and constant internal environment
	The #Kidneys respond if #[[Blood]]-Pressure decreases, if the #pH of the #Blood decreases, or if the number of red blood cells decreases
