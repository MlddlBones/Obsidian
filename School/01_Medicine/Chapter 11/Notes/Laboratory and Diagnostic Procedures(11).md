#Urine-Tests 
	Culture and Sensitivity (C&S)
		Urine test in which some urine is swabbed onto a culture medium in a Petri dish. This is done to identify the cause of a urinary tract infection. Microorganisms in the urine grow into colonies. The specific disease-causing microorganism is identified and tested to determine its sensitivity to various antibiotic drug

	Drug Screening
	[[Leukocyte]] Esterase
	24-hour Creatinine clearance
	Urinalysis (UA)
		**Color**- 
			Normal urine is light yellow to amber in color, depending on its concentration
		**Odor**-
			 Urine has a faint odor to the waste products in it
		**pH**- 
			A test of how acidic or alkaline the urine is
		**Protein**-
			 not normally found in the urine; its presence indicates damage to the #Glomerulus
		**Glucose**- 
			Not normally found in the urine; presence indicated uncontrolled diabetes mellitus
		**Red Blood Cells ( #RBCs)**
		**White Blood Cells ( #WBCs)**
		**Ketones**- 
			not normally found in the urine; produced when the body cannot use (or does not have enough) glucose and instead metabolizes fat
		**Specific Gravity (SP)**
		**Sediment**
		**Other Substances**
		**Urine Protein Electrophoresis**

			Urinometer
				A refractometer(Urinometer) is a handheld instrument that performs a quick measurement of urine specific gravity; it uses light rays that are bent (refracted) by a thin layer of urine spread on glass

	[[Kidneys]], [[Ureters]], [[Bladder]] (KUB) x-ray
	Nephrotomography
	Renal Angiography
		 Radiologic procedure that uses x-rays and radiopaque contrast dye. The dye is injected intravenously and flows through the [[Blood]] into the renal artery. It outlines the renal [[Artery]] and shows any obstruction or blockage. It is also known as renal arteriography. The x-ray image is known as a renal angiogram or renal arteriogram
	Renal Scan
	Ultrasonography
		Radiologic procedure that uses ultrahigh-frequency sound waves emitted by a transducer or probe to produce an image of the [[Urinary System]]. It is done to look for kidney stones, cysts, tumors, blockages, or infection. The ultrasound image is known as a sonogram 
Other
	Cystometry
	Voiding Cystourethrography (VCUG)
