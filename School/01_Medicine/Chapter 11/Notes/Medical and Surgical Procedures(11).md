#Medical-Procedure 
	Catheterization
		A #Condom-Catheter is shaped like a condom (male contraceptive device). It fits snugly over the penis and collects urine as it leaves the urethral meatus
		A #Foley-Catheter is an indwelling tube that drains urine continuously. It has an expandable balloon tip that keeps it positioned in the bladder. The urine is collected in a bag.
		A #Straight-Catheter can be inserted if the bladder becomes full and the patient is unable to urinate, or it can be used to obtain a single sterile urine specimen for testing.
		A #Suprapubic-Catheter is inserted through the abdominal wall (just above the pubic [[Bone]]) and into the bladder. It is sometimes inserted after bladder or prostate gland surgery
