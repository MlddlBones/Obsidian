The #Parenchyma is the functional or working #Tissue of an #Organ 

The #Nephron, a microscopic structure, is the functional unit of the #Kidney and the site of #urine-Production 
	The first part of the #Nephron is the #Glomerular-Capsule
	The #Blood that enters the #Nephron also contains the following nutritional substances
		#Electrocytes 
		#Glucose 
		#Amino-Acids 
		#Vitamins
	Within this ball-shaped structure the #Arteriole becomes the #Glomerulur a network of intertwining #[[Capillaries]] 
	Waste products in the #Blood include
		#Urea
		#Creatine
		#Uric-Acid
		Drugs and products of drug metabolism
	The pressure of the #Blood pushes nutritional substances, water, and waste products through the #Capillary pores and into the ball-shaped collecting area of #Glomerular-Capsule 
		This process is known as #Filtration

The #Filtrate (Nutritional Substances, water, and Waste Products) in the #Glomerular-Capsule flows into the #Proximal-Convoluted-Tubule of the #Nephron 
	Most of the water and nutritional substances move out of the #Tubule and return to the [[Blood]]
	This process is known as #Reabsorption
The #Proximal-Convoluted-Tubule becomes a U-shaped #Tubule known as the #Nephron-Loop
	In the #Nephron-Loop, more water, and #Electrocytes are #Reabsorbed
	The #Nephron-Loop widens to become the #Distal-Convoluted-Tubule where more water and #Electrocytes as well as #Amino-Acids and other nutritional substances, are #Reabsorbed 
	#Urine is produced continuously by #Nephron in the kidneys

This Process is described in several ways
	#Urination 
	#Micturition
	#Voiding
	#Passing-Water
