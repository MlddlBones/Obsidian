#Erythorocyte , the most numerous of the formed elements within #[[Plasma]] 

#Red-[[Blood]]-Cells are round somewhat flattened, red disks
	unlike other cells in the body they do **not possesses** a nucleus by the time they mature
	Contain #Hemoglobin 
		Red, iron-contain molecule that bind to O2 to form #Oxyhemoglobin 

#Hemoglobin carries O2 from the #[[Lungs]] to every cell in the body and carries CO2 from the cells back to the #[[Lungs]] 

#Erythrocyte #Stem-Cell mature to become #Erythroblasts  and #normoblasts 

#Reticulocytes 
	immature #Erythrocyte that is released into the [[Blood]]

#Erythropoietin  
	hormone from the [[Kidneys]] that increases #Erythrocyte production

Cannot divide or repair as they **Do not have a nucleus**
Lasts **120 days** before they begin to deteriorate
The #Spleen is tasked with removing old #Erythrocyte from [[Blood]], breaking down their #Hemoglobin into #Heme and #Globins
	iron stripped from #Heme molecules is stored in the #[[Liver]] and #Spleen the remaining #Heme molecules are converted to #Bilirubin
