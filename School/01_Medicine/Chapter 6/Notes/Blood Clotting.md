#[[Blood]]-Clotting 
	#Platelet aggregation: #[[Thrombocytes]] form clumps to decrease [[Blood]] loss
	#Coagulation : [[Blood]] Clot forms
	#Hemostasis : Cessation of bleeding

When clotting factors in the #[[Plasma]] are activated to form a [[Blood]] clot, the fluid portion of #[[Plasma]] that remains is known as #Serum
