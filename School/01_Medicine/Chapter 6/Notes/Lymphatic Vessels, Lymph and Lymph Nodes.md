Lymphatic vessels are similar in structure to [[Blood Vessels]] but with several differences

Begin as tiny #Lymphatic-[[Capillaries]] in the tissues

End as #Lymphatic-Ducts that empty into large #[[Veins]] in the neck

tissue fluid enter a #Lymphatic-Capillary and becomes #Lymph
	the fluid that circulates through the [[Lymphatic System]]

#Lymphatic-[[Capillaries]] have large opening in their walls that allow #Microorganisms and Cancerous cells to enter

#Lymphatic-[[Capillaries]] become larger #Lymphatic vessels that brings #Lymph to the #Lymph-Nodes

Valves keep the #Lymph **flowing in one direction**

#Lymph-Nodes 
	Filter #Lymph 
	Contain #Macrophages that destroy #Microorganisms or Cancer cells
	Grouped in chain in areas invaded by #Microorganisms or Cancerous cells
