		Aplastic anemia
			Anemia that is characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets produced by [[Bone]] marrow
			Aplastic anemia is a severe hematologic condition in which the body fails to make blood cells in sufficient numbers. Blood cells are produced in the [[Bone]] marrow by stem cells that reside there. Aplastic anemia causes a deficiency of all blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
		Folic Acid Deficiency anemia
		Iron Deficiency anemia
			Iron-deficiency anemia is anemia caused by a lack of iron. Anemia is defined as a decrease in the number of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. When onset is slow, symptoms are often vague such as feeling tired, weak, short of breath, or having decreased ability to exercise.
		Pernicious anemia
			one of the causes of Vitamin B12 deficiency, autoimmune disease that prevent your body from absorbing B12
			Without adequate vitamin B12, you have fewer [red blood cells](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21691-function-of-red-blood-cells) carrying oxygen throughout your body.
			You can have pernicious anemia for several years before noticing changes in your body. Left untreated, pernicious anemia can cause serious medical issues, including irreversible damage to your [nervous system](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21202-nervous-system). Healthcare providers treat pernicious anemia by prescribing [vitamin B12 supplements](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20271-vitamin-b12-capsules-or-tablets).
		[Sickle Cell anemia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4579-sickle-cell-anemia)
			severe form of the inherited [[Blood]] disorder, sickle cell disease. It’s caused by genetic changes that lead to abnormal red blood cells and anemia.
			Sickled cells are stiff and sticky and get stuck in your [[Blood Vessels]] instead of flowing throughout your body. Sickled cells also break apart and die more quickly than normal red blood cells. As a result, sickle cell anemia affects your red blood cell supply, so you develop severe [anemia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3929-anemia) (low red blood cell levels).

	Anisocytosis
	Poikilocytosis
	[Polycythemia Vera](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17742-polycythemia-vera)
		type of chronic leukemia (blood cancer) that causes your bone marrow to produce too many red blood cells. It progresses very slowly and often isn’t diagnosed until after the age of 60. Most people manage symptoms well for many years. The biggest risk from too many red blood cells is blood clots.

	[Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4251-hiv-aids?_id=BB7BD0C0BCB944C09755BA17A4EE326E)
		Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
		HIV weakens your immune system by destroying your T-cells until you are unable to fight off even minor illnesses. You can have HIV without any symptoms.
		Because HIV works backward to insert its instructions into your DNA, it is called a retrovirus
		AIDS is the final and most serious stage of an HIV infection. People with AIDS have very low counts of certain white blood cells and severely damaged immune systems.
	[Leukemia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4365-leukemia)
		Leukemia starts when the DNA of a single cell in your [[Bone]] marrow changes nd can’t develop and function normally. Leukemia cells often behave like abnormal white blood cells. Treatments for leukemia depend on the type of leukemia you have, your age and overall health, and if the leukemia has spread to other organs or tissues.
	[Mononucleosis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/13974-mononucleosis)
		Mononucleosis (mono) is a contagious infection caused by a herpes virus called Epstein-Barr. Other viruses can also cause mono. The infection is common among teenagers and young adults. People with mono experience extreme fatigue, fever and body aches. Treatments can ease symptoms until the illness goes away on its own.
	[Multiple Myeloma](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6178-multiple-myeloma)
		healthy [[Plasma]] cells become abnormal cells that multiply and produce abnormal antibodies. This change starts a cascade of medical issues and conditions that can affect your bones, your [[Kidneys]] and your body’s ability to make healthy red and white blood cells and platelets.
		Some people have multiple myeloma without symptoms but [blood tests](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24508-blood-tests) show signs of conditions that may become multiple myeloma. In this case, healthcare providers may recommend watchful waiting or monitoring your overall health rather than starting treatment

		A
			one of three types of hemophilia, a rare, inherited blood disorder. It happens when your blood doesn’t clot as it should, which is when bleeding stops or slows down.
			If you have hemophilia A, you’re missing factor VIII, a blood protein that helps your [[Blood]] to form clots.

	Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD)
	Lymphadenopathy
		Swollen lymph nodes are your body’s natural reaction to illness or infection. These small lumps are soft, tender and often painful. The most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is an upper respiratory infection, but they can have many causes. If they’re enlarged with no obvious cause, see your healthcare provider to rule out something more serious.
