	[[Blood]] type 
	Complete blood count (CBC) with differential
	[Peripheral blood smear](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22742-peripheral-blood-smear-test)
		Technique used to examine red, white blood cells, and platelets under a microscope
		Your healthcare provider may order a peripheral blood smear along with a [complete blood count (CBC)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4053-complete-blood-count), or if you already had CBC and it shows abnormal blood cell activity, they might order a PBS. For example, your CBC results may indicate your white blood cells, red blood cells and/or platelets appear abnormal or that you have an abnormal number of any given type of cell. A microscopic view of your cells may help your healthcare provider find out how and/or why your blood cells look abnormal or you have an abnormal number of cells.

	[Blood chemistries](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-tests/b/blood-test/types/blood-chemistry-study.html)
		procedure in which a [[Blood]] sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it.

	Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tests
		**Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)**: First screening test done for HIV
		**Western blot**: Used to confirm a positive ELISA and make a diagnosis of HIV infection
		**Viral RNA load test**: Measures tiny amount of HIV RNA and monitors progression of the disease and response to antiretroviral drugs
		**p24 antigen test**: Detects the protein p24 in HIV
		**CD4 count**: Used to monitor the progression of the disease and response to antiretroviral drugs
	[Ferritin](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/17820-ferritin-test)
		A ferritin test measures the amount of ferritin in your blood â€” a protein that stores iron inside your cells. This test helps healthcare providers determine if you have a healthy amount of iron in your body.
	[Hemoglobin Electrophoresis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22420-hemoglobin-electrophoresis)
		Process at which analyzes the hemoglobin in red blood cells.
		Sometimes, the gene controlling your hemoglobin changes or mutates, turning healthy red [[Blood]] cells into damaged cells. These damaged cells can break down and cause anemia and other [blood disorders](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21545-blood-disorders) like [sickle cell anemia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4579-sickle-cell-anemia) or [thalassemias.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14508-thalassemias)
