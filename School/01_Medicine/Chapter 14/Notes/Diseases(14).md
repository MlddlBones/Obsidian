		Dwarfism
			Hyposecretion of growth hormone during childhood and puberty. It is caused by a defect in the anterior pituitary gland. The low level of growth hormone causes a lack of growth and short stature, but with normal body proportions. Hyposecretion in adults causes decreased muscle mass, fatigue, and other symptoms. 
			Treatment: Drug therapy with growth hormone

#Posterior-Pituitary-Gland 
	#Antidiuretic-Hormone (ADH)
		Syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH)
		Diabetes Insipidus (DI)
	#Oxytocin 
		Uterine Inertia

#Pineal-Gland
	#Melatonin
		Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
			Hypersecretion of melatonin. The exact cause is not known. Melatonin is normally secreted during the night. The longer nights and decreased hours of sunshine during the winter months may disrupt the body’s circadian rhythm (biological clock) and increase the secretion of melatonin. The high level of melatonin causes depression, weight gain, and an increased desire for food and sleep. There is also a decreased level of the neurotransmitter serotonin that affects the mood. Treatment: Exposure to sunlight or to bright light from a light box (photo- therapy) to suppress melatonin secretion; drug therapy with melatonin and/or an antidepressant drug

#Thyroid-Gland
	#T3 and #T4 #Throid-Hormones
		Hyperthyroidism
			Thyrotoxicosis
			Graves’ disease
				The most common type of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease. This is an autoimmune disease in which the body produces antibodies that stimulate TSH receptors on the [[Thyroid Gland]], and this increases the production of thyroid hormones. The entire thyroid gland becomes enlarged (diffuse toxic goiter), and there is exophthalmos. 
			Goiter or Thromegaly
			Hypersecretion of T3 and T4 thyroid hormones. It is caused by an adenoma (or nodule) in the thyroid gland. (It can also be caused by an adenoma in the anterior [[Pituitary Gland]] that causes hypersecretion of TSH that stimulates the overproduction of T3 and T4.) The high levels of T3 and T4 cause tremors of the hands, tachycardia, palpitations, restlessness, nervousness, diarrhea, insomnia, fatigue, and generalized weight loss. The thyroid gland is enlarged (a goiter) and can be felt on palpation of the neck. The eyes are dry and irritated with slow eyelid closing (“lid lag”). 
			Treatment: Antithyroid drug to suppress the secretion of T3 and T4 or surgery to remove the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy), with radiation therapy with radioactive iodine to destroy the remaining thyroid gland
		Hypothyroidism
		Thyroid Carcinoma
		Thyroiditis

#Parathyroid-Glands
	#Parathyroid-Hormone
		Hyperparathyroidism
		Hypoparathyroidism

#Pancreas 
	#Insulin 
		Hyperinsulinism
		Insulin Resistance Syndrome
		Diabetes Mellitus (DM)
			Hyposecretion of insulin. It is caused by an inability of the beta cells of the [[Pancreas]] to secrete enough insulin. A person who has diabetes mellitus is a diabetic. Laypersons call it “sugar diabetes.” The word mellitus means honeyed. In the past, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed by tasting the urine which had a sweet taste. 
			Treatment: Drug therapy with injections of insulin or an oral antidiabetic drug (depending on the type of diabetes mellitus); diet management, weight control, and exercise; ongoing consultation with a diabetologist physician or a certified diabetes educator (CDE)

			-osis

#Adrenal-Cortex
	#Aldosterone
		Hyperaldosteronism
		Hypoaldosteronism
	#Cortisol
		Cushing’s Syndrome
			Cushing disease is caused by hypersecretion of cortisol from an adenoma in the [[Adrenal Cortex]]. Cushing syndrome occurs in a patient who takes corticosteroid drugs on a long-term basis. The high level of cortisol stimulates the [[Liver]] to convert too much glycogen to glucose, causing a high level of glucose in the blood. This results in rapid weight gain, with deposits of fat in the face (moon face), upper back (buffalo hump), and abdomen . There is a thinning of connective tissue in the [[Skin]] of the face that allows the [[Blood Vessels]] to show through, giving a reddened appearance to the cheeks. The thinned connective tissue in the skin across the obese abdomen is stretched, causing small hemorrhages and red and purple striae. There is also a wasted appearance of the muscles in the extremities and muscle weakness because of the lack of protein synthesis. 
			Treatment: Surgery to remove the adenoma; discontinue corticosteroid drugs
