The #Endocrine-System uses #Hormones as #Chemical-Messengers.

Some #NeuroTransmitters ( #Epinephrine* and #Norepinephrine) are also
#Hormones because they are secreted by a #Gland and travel in the #[[Blood]].
	*Hormone secreted by the adrenal medulla in response to a nerve impulse from the sympathetic division of the [[Nervous System]] during times of danger or anger. It produces the “fight-or-flight” response.

#Hormones target specific #Glands or #Organs with receptors to which they can bind.

#Synergism: When two(2) #Hormones work in conjunction with one another to accomplish an enhanced effect

#Antagonism: When two(2) #Hormones exert an opposite effect

The #Endocrine-System maintains body #Homeostasis through the use of #Hormones and a #Negative-Feedback-Mechanism
