The #Pituitary-Gland is located in the #[[Brain]] at the end of the stalk from the #Hypothalamus. Known as the #Master-Gland of the body. Contains two(2) different #Lobes that function independently of each other
	The #Anterior-Pituitary-Gland 
	The #Posterior-Pituitary-Gland 

The #Anterior-Pituitary-Gland ( #Adenohypophysis)secretes seven(7) #Hormones 
	#Thyroid-Stimulating-Hormone ( #TSH)
	#Follicle-Stimulation-Hormone ( #FSH)
	#Luteinizing-Hormone ( #LHo)
	#Prolactin 
	#Adrenocorticotropic-Hormine ( #ACTH)
	#Growth-Hormone ( #GH)
	#Melanocyte-Stimulating-Hormone ( #MSH)

The #Posterior-Pituitary-Gland releases two(2) #Hormones 
	#Antidiuretic-Hormone ( #ADH)
	#Oxytocin 
	Lobe of the pituitary gland that stores and secretes ADH and oxytocin produced by the hypothalamus; it secretes these hormones in response to a nerve impulse from the [[Hypothalamus]]. Also known as the neurohypophysis
