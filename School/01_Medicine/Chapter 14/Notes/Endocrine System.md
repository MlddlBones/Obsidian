The #Endocrine-System includes
	#[[Hypothalamus]] 
	#Pituitary-Gland 
	#Pineal-Gland 
	#Thyroid-Gland 
	#Parathyroid-Glands 
	#Thymus
	#Pancreas 
	#Adrenal-Glands
	#Ovaries 
	#Testes 

All #Endocrine-Glands are alike in specific ways
	The secrete substances known as #Hormones 
	They secrete their #Hormones directly into the #[[Blood]] and not through ducts
	Their #Hormones regulate specific body functions

One of the functions of the #Endocrine-System is to keep the body in #Homeostasis by regulating body fluids, #Electrocytes, #Glucose, #Cell-Metabolism, growth, and the wake-sleep cycle.

Some #Endocrine-Glands do “Double Duty” as part of another body system
	#Nervous-System with the #Hypothalamus 
	#Immune-System with the #Thymus 
	#Digestive-System with the #[[Pancreas]] 
	#Genital-and-Reproductive-System with the #[[Ovaries]] and #[[Testes]] 

#Synergism, Process in which two hormones work together to accomplish an
enhanced effect
