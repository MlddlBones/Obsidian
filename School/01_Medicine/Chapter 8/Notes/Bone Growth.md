#Ossification is the gradual replacing of #Cartilage with [[Bone]] that takes place during childhood and adolescence
	New #[[Bone]] is formed along the #Epiphyseal growth plates at the ends of #Long-bone as the body grows taller

About 10% of the entire skeleton is broken down and rebuilt each year, this process occurs in areas that are damaged or subjected to mechanical stress

#Osteoclasts break down areas of old or damaged bone
	#Osteoblasts deposit new #Bone-Tissue in those areas
	#Osteocytes maintain and monitor the mineral content (Calcium, phosphorus) of the #[[Bone]] 
		Almost all og the bonyâ€™s calcium is stored in the #[[Bone]] but calcium is needed to help the #[[Heart]] and #Skeletal-Muscle contract
		Calcium comes from foods but is also released into the [[Blood]] as #Osteoclasts
