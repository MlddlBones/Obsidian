	Bunionectomy
		Bunion/o- bunion
		-ectomy surgical excision
		Bunion surgery (bunionectomy) is surgery to remove a bunion from the joint where your big toe meets your foot. Your surgeon will use one of four surgery techniques to remove the bunion and realign your toe. Most people experience noticeably less pain and other symptom relief once they recover.
	Cartilage Transplantation
	External Fixation
		External fixation is a surgical treatment wherein Kirschner pins and wires are inserted and affixed into [[Bone]] and then exit the body to be attached to an external apparatus composed of rings and threaded rods — the Ilizarov apparatus, the Taylor Spatial Frame, and the Octopod External Fixator — which immobilises the damaged limb to facilitate healing.
	[Arthroplasty (Joint Replacement)](Joint replacement surgery)
		Arthroplasty is surgery to replace all or some of a joint. Your surgeon will replace worn-out or damaged [[Bone]] and cartilage in your natural joint with a prosthetic implant. It usually takes at least a few months to recover after an arthroplasty. Your recovery time will depend on which joint needs a replacement.
