		Spine postural abnormalities in which [[Vertebral Column]] has three dimensional curvature
		Scoliosis is a side-to-side curve of your spine. This differs from your body’s natural front-to-back curve. It’s usually mild and doesn’t cause symptoms, but it can lead to back pain and abnormal posture. A healthcare provider most often diagnoses this condition during adolescence. Treatment includes physical therapy, braces and surgery.

	Ankylosing Spondylitis
		Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis that affects the joints in your spine. It usually develops in your sacroiliac joints (where the bottom of your spine joins your pelvis). It causes typical arthritis symptoms like pain and stiffness, but it can also cause digestive symptoms, rashes and weight loss.
	 [Hemarthrosis (Joint Bleeding)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24225-hemarthrosis-joint-bleeding)
		 Hemarthrosis is bleeding into the space around one of your joints. It most commonly affects people’s knees, but can happen to any joint that moves (your synovial joints). A healthcare provider will treat the cause of the bleeding. You’ll probably be able to manage symptoms like swelling and pain with at-home treatments.

			Bilateral hallux valgus
		Bunions happen when something puts extra pressure on your big toe and pushes it out of its natural alignment and toward your other toes. Visit a healthcare provider if you notice a bump at the base of your big toe. Treating bunions is usually a combination of wearing properly fitting shoes and treating any symptoms like pain and stiffness.

		Bilateral Clubfeet
		Clubfoot is a congenital (present at birth) condition in which your baby’s foot or feet turn inward. It won’t go away on its own, but with early treatment, children experience good results. Approximately 1 in every 1,000 babies will be born with clubfoot, which makes it one of the more common congenital foot deformities.
	[[Bone]] Spur (Osteophyte)
		[[Bone]] spurs are a common side effect of aging, osteoarthritis and tissue injury. They’re extra growths of [[Bone]] tissue that look like smooth lumps on your [[Bone]]. They often don’t cause any symptoms, but if they do, treatment can help. Surgery to remove a [[Bone]] spur is a last resort.
