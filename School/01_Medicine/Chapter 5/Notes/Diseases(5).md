#Myocardium
	Acute Coronary Syndrome
		a condition brought on by the sudden blockage/reduction of [[Blood]] flow
	Angina Pectoris
		chest pain caused by reduced [[Blood]] flow to the [[Heart]]	
	Cardiomegaly
		abnormally thick or overly stretched, becoming larger than usual, with difficulty pumping blood
	Cardiomyopathy
		any disorder that affects the [[Heart]] muscle
	Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
		long-term condition that happens when your heart can't pump blood well enough to give your body a normal supply.
	Myocardial Infarction (MI)
		"heart attack,"
		caused by decreased or complete cessation of blood flow to a portion of the myocardium.
#Heart-Valves and Layers of the Heart
	Endocarditis
		life-threatening inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves.
		This lining is called the endocardium.
	Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)
		the valve's flaps do not always fit and close properly between each beat of the heart
	Murmur
		Sound of blood flowing through the heart, due to anything from healthy heart exertion during exercise to a diseased heart valve or other abnormality.
	Pericarditis
		Peri- around
		card/i- heart
		-itis inflammation of; infection of
		Infection around the heart
		Pericarditis, an infection with an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, can lead to cardiac tamponade, a condition in which the fluid presses on the heart and stops it from beating.
	Rheumatic Heart Disease
		condition where the heart valves have been permanently damaged
#Conduction-System
	Arrhythmia
		a problem with the rate or rhythm of your [[HeartBeat]]
				![[Pasted image 20240926120211.png]]
	Bradycardia
		a condition where your heart beats fewer than 60 times per minute
	Fibrillation
		a heart condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate.
	Flutter
		type of heart rhythm disorder
		heart's upper chambers, called the atria, beat too quickly.
	Heart Block
		occurs when the electrical signals from the top chambers of your heart don't conduct properly to the bottom chambers of your heart
	Premature Contraction
		the [[HeartBeat]] is initiated by the Purkinje fibers rather than the SA node
	Sick Sinus Syndrome
		group of [[Heart]] rhythm problems due to problems with the sinus node
	Tachycardia
		tachy- fast
		card/i- [[Heart]]
		-ia condition; state; thing
		Condition of a fast [[HeartBeat]]
#Blood-Vessels
	Aneurysm
		bulging, weakened area in the wall of a [[Blood]] vessel resulting in an abnormal widening or ballooning greater than 50% of the vessel's normal diameter
		Aneurysms often occur in the aorta, [[Brain]], back of the knee, intestine, or spleen. A ruptured aneurysm can result in internal bleeding, stroke, and can sometimes be fatal.
	Arteriosclerosis
	Bruit
	Coronary [[Artery]] Disease (CAD)
	Hyperlipidemia
	Hypertension (HTN)
		when the pressure in your [[Blood Vessels]] is too high
	Hypotension
		Low blood pressure occurs when [[Blood]] pressure is much lower than normal.
	Peripheral [[Artery]] Disease (PAD)
	Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD)
	Phlebitis
	Raynaudâ€™s Disease
	Varicose [[Veins]]
	Cardiac Enzymes
	C-Reactive Protein (CPR)
	Homocysteine
	Lipid Profile
	Troponin
