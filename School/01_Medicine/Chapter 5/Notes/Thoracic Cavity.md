		the #Visceral-Pleura is the layer next to the lung surface while
		the #Parietal-Pleura is the layer next to the wall of the thorax
		The #Pleura secretes fluid
			slippery watery fluid that allows the 2 layers to slide smoothly past each other as the [[Lungs]] expand and contract during [[Respiration]]


The #Thoracic-Cavity Contains the #[[Lungs]] and the #Mediastinum, an irregularly shaped central area between the [[Lungs]]

#Mediastinum
