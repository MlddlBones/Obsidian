#Prostate-Gland
	Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH)
	Cancer of the Prostate Gland
		Cancerous tumor of the prostate gland. It is categorized as an adenocarcinoma because it begins in a gland. This is the most common cancer in men. There are few early symptoms or signs because the cancer grows slowly. Later, the cancer makes the prostate gland feel hard or nodular on digital rectal examination. 
		Treatment: “Watch-and-wait” approach if the cancer is small and the patient is elderly; surgery to remove the prostate gland (prostatectomy); radiation therapy, cryotherapy, or chemotherapy drugs
	Prostatitis
#Penis 
	Balanitis
		Infection and inflammation of the glans penis. It is often associated with phimosis (described later) or with inadequate hygiene of the prepuce. 
		Treatment: Antibiotic drug (for a bacterial infection); antifungal drug (for a yeast or fungal infection)
	Chordee
	Dyspareunia
		Painful or difficult sexual intercourse or postcoital pain. It is caused by infection of the penis or prostate gland, chordee of the penis, or phimosis. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause.
	Erectile Dysfunction (ED)
		inability to achieve or sustain an erection of the penis. It can be caused by hypertension, arteriosclerosis that blocks [[Blood]] flow into the penis, a neurologic disease (such as a [[Spinal Cord]] injury) that impairs sensory stimuli and nerve transmission, diabetes mellitus, a low level of testosterone, smoking, alcoholism, the side effects of certain drugs, or psychological factors. Also known as impotence. 
		Treatment: Drug to stimulate an erection; penile implant
	Phimosis
	Premature Ejaculation
		[[Ejaculation]] of semen that occurs with minimal stimulation and before the penis becomes fully erect. This lessens the enjoyment of sexual intercourse and decreases the chance of conception. It can be caused by a hormone imbalance but is more often caused by stress or a psychological reason. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause.
	Priapism
		Abnormal, continuing erection of the penis with pain and tenderness. It is caused by a spinal cord injury or the side effect of a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause.
	Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD)
		Infectious disease that is contracted during sexual intercourse with an infected individual. The presence of a sexually transmitted disease means that the patient and all sexual partners need to be treated. Sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed to a fetus (in the [[Uterus]] or as it is born), causing serious illness, blindness, and even death. Also known as a sexually transmitted infection (STI). 
		Treatment: Antibiotic drug, antiviral drug, or antiretroviral drugs
