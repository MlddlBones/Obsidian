#Vas-Deferens, #Seminal-Vesicles, and #Ejaculatory-Ducts 
	The #Vas-Deferens is a long tube that receives #Spermatoza from the #Epididymis 
		#Spermatoza can be sotred within the #Vas-Deferens for several month in an inactive state
		goes ehind the #[[Bladder]] where is merges with a #Seminal-Vesicles 
	#Seminal-Vesicles produce #Seminal-Fluid, which makes up most of the volume of #Semen 
	#Ejaculatory-Ducts is a large collecting duct that holds #Spermatoza and #Seminal-Fluid 
		enters the #Prostate-Gland then joins the #Urethra within the #Prostate-Gland 

#Prostate-Gland is a donut-shaped gland at the base of the #Bladder 
	It produces #Prostatic-Fluid
		#Prostatic-Fluid contains an #Antibiotic substance that kills bacteria and also contain #Acid-Phosphatase, an #Enzyme that breaks the deposit of #Semen apart and releases the #Spermatoza in the womanâ€™s #Vagina 

#Bulbourethral-Glands, small bulblike glands, about the size of peas, located on either side of the #Urethra just below the #Prostate-Gland 
	Produces thick mucus that makes up some of the volume within #Semen 
	Mucus helps #Spermatoza survive by neutralizing the acidity of any urine remaining in the #[[Urethra]]  at the time of #[[Ejaculation]] and neutralizing the normally acidic environment of the female #[[Vagina]]
