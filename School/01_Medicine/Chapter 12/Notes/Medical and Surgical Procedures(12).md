#Surgical-Procedures 
	Biopsy
	Circumcision
	Orchiectomy
		Procedure to remove a testis because of testicular cancer 
	Orchiopexy
		Procedure done in an infant to reposition an undescended testis and fix it within the scrotum. Orchiopexy is also used to treat male infertility in an adult.

	Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP)
		Procedure to reduce the size of the prostate gland in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. A special cystoscope (a resectoscope) is inserted through the urethra. It has built-in cutting instruments and cautery to resect pieces of the prostate gland and cauterize bleeding [[Blood Vessels]]. Chips of prostatic tissue are then irrigated out. Newer techniques vaporize prostatic tissue by using a laser, microwaves and heat, or radio waves and heat. The newer surgeries produce the same results as a TURP, but with less bleeding and a shorter recovery time.
		• Laser. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) and photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) use a laser to destroy prostatic tissue.
		• Microwaves and heat. Transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT) uses a microwave antenna on a catheter inserted through the [[Urethra]] to destroy prostatic tissue.
		• Radio waves and heat. Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) uses a resectoscope to place needles in the prostate gland to destroy prostatic tissue with radio waves and heat.

	Vasectomy
		Procedure in the male to prevent pregnancy in the female. Through a small incision in the scrotum, each vas deferens is identified. A length of each tube is removed, and the cut ends are sutured or destroyed with electrocautery. Spermatozoa continue to be produced by each testis, but they are eventually broken down and absorbed back into the body. 
		A **vasovasostomy** is a reversal of a vasectomy. The cut ends of the vas deferens are rejoined so that spermatozoa are again present in the semen and the male can cause a female to become pregnant.
