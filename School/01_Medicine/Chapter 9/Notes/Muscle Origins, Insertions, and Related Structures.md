A #Muscle is attached to a #[[Bone]] by a #Tendon, a cordlike, non-elastic, white fibrous band of #Connective-Tissue 

The origin of a #Muscles is where its #Tendon is attached to stationary (Or nearly stationary)

The #Insertion or ending of a #Muscle is where its #Tendon is attached to the #[[Bone]] that moves when the #Muscle contracts and relaxes.

The belly of a #Muscles is where its mass is the greatest, usually midway between the origin and insertion

A #Bursa, a thin sac of #Synovial-Membrane filled with #Synovial-Fluid, acts as a cushion to reduce triction where a #Tendon rubs against the #[[Bone]] 

Each #Muscle is wrapped in #Fascia a thin #Connective-Tissue that joins to the #Tendon 

#Aponeurosis is #Connective-Tissue that attaches a flat #Muscle to #[[Bone]] or to other, deeper #Muscles 

#Retinaculum is a band of #Fibrous-Tissue and #Fascia that holds down the #Extesor and #Flexor #Tendons that cross the wrist and ankle
