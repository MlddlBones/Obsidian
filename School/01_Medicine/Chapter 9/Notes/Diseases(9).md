#Muscles
	Atrophy
		Loss of muscle bulk in one or more muscles (see Figure 8-18 ■). It is caused by a lack of use, by paralysis in which the muscles receive no electrical impulses from the nerves, by a lack of a muscle protein in muscular dystrophy, or by severe malnutrition .The muscle is atrophic. Also known as muscle wasting .Treatment: Correct the underlying cause.
	Avulsion
		Condition in which the muscle tears away from the tendon or the tendon tears away from the [[Bone]]
		Treatment: Surgical repair (myorrhaphy or tenorrhaphy)
	Compartment
	Syndrome
	Contracture
		Condition in which a muscle becomes progressively more flexed. As it continues to receive nerve impulses, it finally becomes flexed in an immovable position. Contractures are seen in nursing home patients in wheelchairs or in bed and in patients with some muscular and neurological diseases. 
		Treatment: Range of motion (ROM) exercises

	Fibromyalgia
		Pain located at specific trigger points in the muscles of the neck, back, or hips. The trigger points are hyperirritable, hypersensitive areas that are tender and cause musculoskeletal pain when touched. The cause of fibromyalgia is not known, but may be related to an overreaction to painful stimuli with a possible history of prior injury or a genetic predisposition. Fibromyalgia is associated with disturbed sleep patterns and sometimes depression. 
		Treatment: Analgesic drug; muscle relaxant drug; drug that affects calcium channels in the skeletal muscles; trigger point injections with a local anesthetic drug; massage therapy
	Hyperextension-hyperflexion injury
	Muscle Contusion
		Contu/o- Brusing
		-ion action; condition
	Muscle Spasms
		Painful but temporary condition with a sudden, severe, involuntary contraction of a muscle, often in the legs. It can be brought on by overexercise. Also known as a muscle cramp. Torticollis is a painful spasm of the muscles on one side of the neck. Also known as wryneck. 
		Treatment: Massage; muscle relaxant drug; analgesic drug
	Muscle Strain
	Muscular Dystrophy

	Myalgia
	Myasthenia Gravis
	Myopathy
	Myositis
	Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)
	Rhabdomyoma
	Rhabdomyosarcoma
	Rotator Cuff Tear
#Movement-Disorders
	Ataxian
		ncoordination of the muscles during movement, particularly incoordination of the gait. It is caused by a disease of the [[Brain]] or [[Spinal Cord]], cerebral palsy, or an adverse reaction to a drug. The patient is ataxic. 
		Treatment: Correct the underlying cause; leg braces or crutches, if needed
	Bradykinesia
		Abnormally slow muscle movements or a decrease in the number of spontaneous muscle movements. It is usually associated with Parkinson disease, a neurologic disease of the [[Brain]]. Treatment: Drug for Parkinson disease
	Dyskinsia
		Abnormal motions that occur because of difficulty controlling the voluntary muscles. Attempts at movement become tics, muscle spasms, muscle jerking (myoclonus), or slow, wandering, purposeless writhing of the hand (athetoid movements) in which some muscles of the fingers are flexed and others are extended. It is associated with neurologic disorders (Parkinson disease ,Huntington chorea, cerebral palsy, etc.).Treatment: Correct the underlying cause.
	Hyperkinesis
		An abnormally increased amount of muscle movements. Restlessness. It can be a side effect of a drug. Treatment: Correct the underlying cause.
	Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
		An uncomfortable restlessness and twitching of the muscles of the legs, particularly the calf muscles, along with an indescribable tingling, aching, or crawling-insect sensation. This usually occurs at night and can interfere with sleep. The exact cause is unknown but may be related to the presence of chronic diseases and inflammation. Treatment: Analgesic drug; iron supplement; sedative drug for sleep
	Tremor
		Small, involuntary, sometimes jerky, back-and-forth movements of the hands, head, jaw, or extremities. These are continuous and cannot be controlled by the patient and are usually due to essential familial tremor, an inherited condition. Treatment: Beta-blocker drug
#Bursa, #Fascia, or #Tendon
	Bursitis
	Dupuytren’s Contracture
		Disease in which collagen fibers in the fascia in the palm of the hand become progressively thickened and shortened. This causes a contracture and flexion deformity of the finger. The cause is not known, but many patients have other family members who are affected by it. 
		Treatment: Injection of a drug to dissolve the collagen fibers; surgery to remove the fascia (fasciectomy)
	Fasciitis
	Ganglion
		Semisolid or fluid-containing cyst that develops on a tendon, often in the wrist, hand, or foot. A ganglion is a rounded lump under the [[Skin]] that may or may not be painful. 
		Treatment: Needle aspiration of fluid from the ganglion or surgical removal (ganglionectomy)

	epicondylitis
		Inflammation and pain of muscles and their tendons that originate on an epicondyle, a rounded protrusion of [[Bone]] on each side (lateral and medial) of the distal humerus.
		Lateral epicondylitis involves the muscles of the forearm where their tendons originate on the lateral epicondyle of the humerus (by the elbow joint). It is an overuse injury caused by repeated extension and pronation of the wrist. Also known as tennis elbow
		Medial epicondylitis involves the muscles of the forearm where their tendons originate on the medial epicondyle of the humerus. This is an overuse injury caused by repeated flexing of the wrist while the fingers tightly grasp an object. Also known as golfer’s elbow or pitcher’s elbow
	Shin Splint
	Tendinitis
	Tennis Elbow
		Inflammation and pain of muscles and their tendons that origi-nate on an epicondyle, a rounded protrusion of [[Bone]] on eachside (lateral and medial) of the distal humerus.
	Tenosynovitis
		ten/o- tendon
		synov/o- synovium (membrane)
		-itis inflammation of; infection
