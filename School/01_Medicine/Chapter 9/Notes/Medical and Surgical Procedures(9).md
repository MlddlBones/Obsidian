	Deep Tendon Reflexes (DTR)
		Procedure that tests whether the muscularâ€“nervous pathway is functioning normally. Tapping briskly on a tendon should cause an involuntary, automatic contraction of the muscle connected to that tendon. This test can be done in several places, but the most common site is at the knee. Also known as the knee jerk or patellar [[Reflex]] because it is near the patella [[Bone]] (kneecap)
