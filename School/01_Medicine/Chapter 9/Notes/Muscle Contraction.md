A #Muscle is composed of several #Muscle-Fascicles, each of which is wrapped in #Fascia 
	Each #Muscle-Fascicles is a bundle of individual #Muscle-Fibers
		These run Parallel to each other so that, when they contract, they all pull in the same direction
		A #Muscle-Fibers (Which is actually one long muscle cell) has hundreds(100s) of #Nuclei along its length to speed up the chemical processes that occur as it contracts
		Each #Muscle-Fibers is composed of #Myofibrils that contain the proteins #Actin and #Myosin
A #Muscle contracts in response to an electrical impulse from a #Nerve 
	Each #Muscle-Fibers is connected to a single #Nerve-Cell at the #Neuromuscular-Junctions 

#Acetylcholine is a chemical messenger that changes the permeability of the #Muscle-Fibers, which shortens the #Muscle and produces a #Muscle-Contraction

#Muscles are in a state of mild, partial contection because of #Nerve-Impulses from the [[Brain]] and #Spinal-Cord
