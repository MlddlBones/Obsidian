### Strategy Notes:

- **Lead Options:** _Mismagius_ and _Gengar_ make excellent leads to set up or disrupt the opponent early. _Blissey_ can also work as a lead against teams that rely heavily on special attackers.
- **Offensive Core:** _Chandelure_ and _Dragapult_ provide strong offensive pressure, with _Aegislash_ as a mixed attacker capable of handling multiple roles.
- **Status and Control:** _Blissey_ supports the team with Thunder Wave and status removal (if _Heal Bell_ is chosen), while _Aegislash_ and _Gengar_ can take on faster threats with priority moves or disrupt setups.
- **Win Conditions:** _Chandelure_ is a powerful late-game cleaner with either _Choice Specs_ or _Choice Scarf_, and _Dragapult_ can clean up weakened teams with its speed and coverage.

This team provides good offensive and defensive balance, with _Chandelure_ giving you excellent Fire-type coverage that complements the Ghost core in single battles.
