	~~Founded in the 26th founding, but quickly disappeared on their mission to eliminate a tyrranid hive fleet invading the solar system that held their Homeworld. Years later post-Cadia a group of Eldar Craft-World comes across their home planet, while fighting orcs within the solar system. ~~
#### Founding
~~A group of Eldar rangers touch down on the surface of a seemingly abandoned planet. As their feet touch the planet surface they are bombarded by what seems like an earthquake, with an accompanying orchestra. Searching or the origin of this music the scouts come across a matte white structure, a theater, and the origin of the earthquake causing music. Walking into the theater all they can do is sit in aww at what seems to be an orchestra made entirely of about 100 space marines. After finishing their song the conductor turns toward the group, His aged phase unlike most space marines, seeming almost like he is more of a musician that a fighter. "Well it seem we finally have an audience" the group of Eldar stand to leave but the conductor stop them with a way of his wand. "Please, i will come to greet you myself, as any good host should." he bends his knees and with a trumpet coo from the orchestra jumps landing in front of the scouts. He reaches his hand for a handshake "I am Melodia Reed, Chapter master of the Space Symphonic Orchestra, Pleased to meet you" Melodia's mouth creaks into a crooked smile, as the Eldar see his ears grow back, melting into horns swirling around the side of his face. "I'm sorry but we were just leaving" one of the rangers speaks, after a small break of quietness, "No i must insist, we have one more song for you after all" Melodia insists, jumping up to his podium readying his orchestra. "Now, My Newest Masterpiece!" clicking his wand on the podium he begins the song. Initially a wonderful march, slowly drowns into you a deafening sludge of noise, a scream comes from the Ranger that first spoke up. Soon after the others began to scream, covering their ears. Melodia glances behind himself, finding pleasure in their pained expressions, he raises his wand, commanding the orchestra to be louder. The Eldar's scream grow in turn. One ear-drum pops than the rest, than they each hit the floor, and the music stops. "Well boys, and girls, and in-between, its time to gather the rest and begin the first of many shows!", Melodia declares to his orchestra. Moldia slides is helmet off, a sereis of tentacles slithering free, connected to a purple face,
Calling on the other 3 orchestras of his symphonies, the Space Symphonic Orchestra takes flight, for the first time in hundreds of years. The unearthing of their ships and taking flight alerts the imperium of man, of their haunting symphony.~~


#### Organization

2nd-5th Orchestra- Unlike the specialized 6th-10th, the 2nd-5th are all Battle companies.

#### Notable Battles and Personnel
Melodia Reed-
#### Marching Song
In the cosmic concert hall, where starlight strings intertwine, The orchestra of shadows plays a symphony of the divine. Each note a soldier marching in formation, A melody that echoes across timeâ€™s vast nation.
/
The brass blasts boldly, like a general's command, While strings whisper secrets of the universe unplanned. Percussion thunders like artillery in the night, As the moon conducts the symphony of light.
/
In the vast expanse, where harmony takes flight, Every crescendo a battle, every silence a quiet fight. A cosmic march unfolds in the theater of the skies, Where music and the military dance in disguise.
/
So listen closely, as the planets play their part, In a galactic opus that resonates with the heart. For in this orchestral march through the void we traverse, Every heartbeat is a measure, every breath a verse.
