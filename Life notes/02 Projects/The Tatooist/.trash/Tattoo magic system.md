Before the greatest kingdoms was a time of pure war, demon kind VS humankind. Neither being able to pull ahead of the other. Until the humans found a mineral called **Undaminite**. Undaminite was found to be able to give powers to those who have engraved it into their skin, a tattoo. This power can be unpredictable being loosely based on the picture drawn, for instance, the mark of a ferocious snake could be summoned, an equally ferocious snake of Monstrous size. A star could grant the power of space itself, a sun the flames of morgen itself, or a moon the power of the darkness that Nacht creates himself.
