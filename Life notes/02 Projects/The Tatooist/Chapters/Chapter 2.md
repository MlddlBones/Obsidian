"Don't take this to harshly Mr. Bradras." plunging the knife into what looks to be his eye, without flinching he begins to talk again. "Ill make things even, kind of, an eye for an eye as they say" wrenching the knife from his eye socket he points it down at Mena's empty eye socket.

As it crawls out the arm begins to expand as muscle starts to form. The tip of horns poke out. Following it a head than body, than nothing. The creature crawling out of the cauldron disappears.

As the Kings hand swings past Mena and the priest the world around them goes white. The demon king has been revived.
