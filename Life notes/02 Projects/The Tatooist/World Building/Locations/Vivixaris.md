"'A black continent, full of death and corruption. It is not of my design, nor your fathers. It seems my son has gone mad, that I've let him go mad. Their is nothing i can do to fix the web itself, but if we can remove my son in time the web might fix itself. If that doesnt work though then those poor mortals might die.' madam web says not looking up from the new web she is spinning, 'Those mortals are my sons, my daughter, they will survive, adapt. i Wont let them die out, but what of your children?'" - Vitas and Madame Web's conversation after the Mad Gods decent
