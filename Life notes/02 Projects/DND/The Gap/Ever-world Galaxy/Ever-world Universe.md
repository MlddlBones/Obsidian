A world of vast ocean was made with the help of Vaituloto and Meer. A giant straight of land mass was then made by Uamea, this was called the #RedLine and slip the ocean in to two. Islands were created to dot these oceans. On of the #RedLine a kingdom was created, a giant kingdom called Raftel. 20 kingdoms formed on the island dotted within the oceans, these kingdoms began to hold grudges open Raftel, and the land it stood on. Banding together the kingdoms waged war open Raftel, a long 100 year war, that would later be erased from history.
