 The Single-Habitat Theory- As long as a god has their own kin, Ie. Vita and humanity, Daemonking and the Daemonkin, Laau and the Fey. A god can only assign one homeplanet/habitat to their kin, Ie. humanity's habitat in the Kekleon Galaxy is Kekleon(Planet), and in the Vaporeon Galaxy it is the Vaporeon(Planet). Under this theory more than one kin can habitat the same planet, Ie. Humanity, Laau, and the Fey all habiting Kekleon(Planet)

Due to most stories within the #Ever-World-Universe following the kin of Vita, the planet they take place on is given the same name as their galaxy.

The #Ever-World-Universe and the #Home-World-Universe have vastly different pantheons, but as they both exist within the #Gap, they are till under the command of the Gods of the Gap
