The fey-land and the Human kingdom have always been in constant conflict. After the death of a god, and a human stealing his sword, The god of the plains and father of all humans has been blamed for his death. The goddess of forests and mother of the fey having been a very close friend of this dead god, is furious, telling her children to remove the humankin from the earth.
With the conflict being on a standstill, a group of misfits(<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Party group</mark>) is called to a remote village to deal with a camp of orcs. Meeting a retired hero, [[Narder Drene.pdf]], they end up getting recruited to help either the " #Vitan-Church" or the " #Purists-of-Mutia", in a coup to be the informant of the young king. At the end of this coup though the Pc's get cornered by the failsafe of the gods, this failsafe tells them that they aren't supposed to exist. Narder dies trying to combat this failsafe, but fails to kill him. Intervening the gods send them of this world to a different universe where they can grow stronger and eventually come back to combat the gods.
