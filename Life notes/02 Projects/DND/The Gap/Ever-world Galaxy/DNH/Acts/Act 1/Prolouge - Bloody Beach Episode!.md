- Group of misfits with barely any qualifications rally under the hunter's guild of a small town outside Helion. Narder Dren, the highest rank hunter in the town, leads this “Oh-So-Fearless” group to snuff out a dangerous group of Orcs that have settled on the beach. What a bloody beach episode this will be. After a beautifully red beach episode a party is held where our unusually naïve party gets to know about the civil war happening within the city. They learn of the two parties taken part in the war and what each want, control over the next king, Prince Roge. At the end of the party Dren addresses the group telling them he is going to the capital to join the civil war. Here the group has a choice between the 2 groups they’ve heard are participating in the war. They rip of their chosen groups recruitment paper and give it to Dren, beginning the journey to the capital the next day
