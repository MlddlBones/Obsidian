#Vita (They/Them)- After the naturals, came the spiritual. Vita filled the land that was made by their siblings, gave them life, freedom, and the ability to feel. Vita believed that their creations could thrive although they aren't sure if that is true anymore.

#Morte (Any)- They were Made to combat Vita in case their creation didn't work out. When Vita's creation went sour he struck a deal, if he sent his servants to take care Vita's creation, Vita would close their eyes and let him do what he wants from then on. Besides her control over death, she has also, in spite of her sibling, given trickery and deceit to Vita's creation, further degrading the purity of life.
