#Guerra of war (He/Him)- One of Vita's unwanted creations. The constant conflicts in the prime plane forced Vita to seal some of their blood lust in a god. As the god of war and bloodshed he doesn't have the best reputation among the gods and the prime plane, but despite that he is quite pleasant outside of a conflict.

#Cattivo (He/Him)- If you ask Vita they do not remember making him, let alone giving him the power of a primal god. He has given the worst to the inhabitants of the prime plane, while Guerra might be the god of bloodshed it was Cattivo who committed the first murder. Morte might be the god of deceit but it was Cattivo who committed the first lie. He takes pride and humor in the chaos he has caused but for how much longer can he sit and watch.
